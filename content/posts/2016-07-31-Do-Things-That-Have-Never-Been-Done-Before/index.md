We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.

A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.

If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.

Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind.

The regret on our side is, they used to say years ago, we are reading about you in science class. Now they say, we are reading about you in history class.

We want to explore. We’re curious people. Look back over history, people have put their lives at stake to go out and explore … We believe in what we’re doing. Now it’s time to go.

I believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine

Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.

Failure is not an option.

Problems look mighty small from 150 miles up.
