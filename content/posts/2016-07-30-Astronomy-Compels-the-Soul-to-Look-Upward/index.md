We want to explore. We’re curious people. Look back over history, people have put their lives at stake to go out and explore … We believe in what we’re doing. Now it’s time to go.

Astronomy compels the soul to look upward, and leads us from this world to another.

For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.

We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.

Dinosaurs are extinct today because they lacked opposable thumbs and the brainpower to build a space program.

Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.

We have an infinite amount to learn both from nature and from each other

To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.

NASA is not about the ‘Adventure of Human Space Exploration’…We won’t be doing it just to get out there in space – we’ll be doing it because the things we learn out there will be making life better for a lot of people who won’t be able to go.

We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.
