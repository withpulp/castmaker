Do you have a bunch of domains just lying around and you plan to turn them into ideas later? Well so do we, we have so many that we don't really know which one to start with. So we decided to create a coming soon page builder to quickly put up landing pages to collect data on our domains. This is the idea behind Castmaker.

This is an ongoing, open source project that anyone can contribute to, feel free to do what you want with the code. As of right now, we're going to include some essential components that will make it easy for people to deploy coming soon pages.

As the project evolves, we'll write up more information as well as develop more features. Our general goal behind this project is to make it really easy to deploy a coming soon page for products or websites currently in development.
